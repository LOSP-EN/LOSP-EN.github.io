*__EverythingTweaks__*  
EverythingTweaks is an xposed module for the EverythingMe Launcher. I created this module only because I like some stand-out features in EverythingMe but I want more features that they may never add to EverythingMe. If you like EverythingMe and need more customizable features, this module is just what you need.

Features:  
* Translucent system bars (statusbar and navigation bar if exists)  
* Transparent "all app" drawer background  
* Icon pack theme (Please read the introduction of icon pack in the module's settings page before using)  
Notice that this module is only __EXPERIMENTAL__ at present, so you might feel these features can't satisfy you. Don't worry, more will be added as new releases come out.

Requirements:  
* The latest EverythingMe Launcher  
* Android 4.4 (or above?) for translucent system bars support or Android 4.0 or above for basical compatibility

Thanks to:  
* CyanogenMod Team  
* AOSP Launcher3  
* Xposed
