Light OpenSource Project, which is often called 'LOSP', was set up by PeterCxy.

LOSP used to be an Android ROM project, which aimed to provide new features and support for legacy devices. Since 2014, we have turned LOSP into an open-source project that aims to provide Xposed modules with features in custom ROMS.

However, LOSP still open the source of its ROM, but it will be pure AOSP except porting code for legacy devices. If you like a pure ROM to run Xposed modules without any conflict, LOSP's source may be the best choice for you to complie. For more information, you can visit the 'Developers' page.

LOSP was set up on 30th Jul, 2013, just want to make it your favourite open-source project.
