title: SwipeBack 2.0.0 Released
---

Our Xposed module, SwipeBack, has a new release as 2.0.0 today.  

In this new release, we did a lot of refactor, just in order to make it more useful.  

For example, we added per-app settings in this new version. This means you can use different swipe gestures for different apps.

Another change is we removed the huge first-run tutorial, because that is really useless.
